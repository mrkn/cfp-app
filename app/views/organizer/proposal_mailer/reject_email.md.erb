    Thank you for submitting your proposal to <%= @event.name %>. Our Program Committee received a large number of high-quality talk submissions this year. On one hand, that has allowed us to put together a very exciting program.

    However, that also means that -- given the sheer number of talks submitted -- we have to decline a lot of excellent proposals. Sadly, that includes your submission -- <%= @proposal.title %>. Knowing that we simply can't fit all the good talks in is always the toughest part of the program selection process.

    Our sincere hope is that you will still be able to attend the conference. To that point, we ensure you the chance to get a single RubyKaigi ticket at the "Super Early Bird" price, even if the general pool of tickets sells out. In that case, please email us at 2017@rubykaigi.org for the discount.

    Thank you again for your submission. We are truly appreciative of your willingness to share your ideas and efforts with our community.

    The <%= @event.name %> Organizers
